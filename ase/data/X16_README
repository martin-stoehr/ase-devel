X16 data set contains PBE+TS optimized geometries and unit cells.
Experimental reference values for lattice energies derived from
enthalpies of sublimation.

Gas phase monomers are constructed in a unit cell of 100 Angstroms cubed
and also optimized using PBE+TS.

Calculations done by A. Tkatchenko, implementation in ASE by M. Stoehr.
