ASE for QM/MM Simulations
=========================

QM/MM Simulations couple two (or, in principle, more) descriptions to get total energy
and forces for the entire system in an efficiant manner. 
ASE has a native Explicit Interaction calculator, :class:`~ase.calculators.qmmm.EIQMMM`, that uses an electrostatic embedding
model to couple the subsystems explicitly. See
`the method paper for more info. <https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.7b00621>`__,

Examples of what this code has been used for can be seen
`here <http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jz500850s>`__,
and `here <http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.inorgchem.6b01840>`__.

This section will show you how to setup up various QM/MM simulations.
We will be using GPAW_ for the QM part. Other QM calculators should
be straightforwardly compatible with the subtractive-scheme SimpleQMMM
calculator, but for the Excplicit Interaction EIQMMM calculator, you
would need to be able to put an electrostatic external potential into
the calculator for the QM subsystem.

Electrostatic Embedding QM/MM
-----------------------------
The total energy expression for the full QM/MM system is:

.. math::  E_\mathrm{TOT} = E_\mathrm{QM} + E_\mathrm{I} + E_\mathrm{MM}.

The MM region is modelled using point charge force fields, with charges
:math:`q_i` and :math:`\tau_i` denoting their spatial coordinates, so the
QM/MM coupling term :math:`E_\mathrm{I}` will be

.. math:: E_\mathrm{I} = \sum_{i=1}^C q_i \int \frac{n({\bf r})}{\mid\!{\bf r} -
                         \tau_i\!\mid}\mathrm{d}{\bf r} +
                         \sum_{i=1}^C\sum_{\alpha=1}^A
                         \frac{q_i Z_{\alpha}}{\mid\!{\bf R}_\alpha - \tau_i\!\mid} + E_\mathrm{RD}

where :math:`n({\bf r})` is the spatial electronic density of the quantum
region, :math:`Z_\alpha` and :math:`{\bf R}_\alpha` are the charge and
coordinates of the nuclei in the QM region, respectively, and
:math:`E_\mathrm{RD}` is the term describing the remaining, non-Coulomb
interactions between the two subsystems.

For the MM point-charge external potential in GPAW, we use the total pseudo-
charge density :math:`\tilde{\rho}({\bf r})` for the coupling, and since the
Coloumb integral is evaluated numerically on the real space grid, thus the
coupling term ends up like this:

.. math:: E_\mathrm{I} = \sum_{i=1}^C q_i \sum_{g} \frac{\tilde{\rho}({\bf r})}{\mid\!{\bf r}_g  - \tau_i\!\mid} v_g + E_\mathrm{RD}

Currently, the term for :math:`E_{\mathrm{RD}}` implemented is a Lennard-
Jones-type potential:

.. math:: E_\mathrm{RD} = \sum_i^C \sum_\alpha^A
                          4\epsilon\left[ \left(\frac{\sigma}{\mid\!{\bf R}_\alpha
                          - \tau_i\!\mid}\right)^{12}
                          - \left(\frac{\sigma}{\mid\!{\bf R}_\alpha
                          - \tau_i\!\mid}\right)^{6} \right]

Let's first do a very simple electrostatic embedding QM/MM single point
energy calculation on the water dimer. The necessary inputs are described in
the :class:`ase.calculators.qmmm.EIQMMM` class.


The following script will calculate the QM/MM single point energy of the
water dimer from the :ref:`s22`, using LDA and TIP3P, for illustration purposes.

.. literalinclude:: water_dimer.py

Here, we have just used the TIP3P LJ parameters for the QM part as well. If
this is a good idea or not isn't trivial. The LJInteractions module needs
combined parameters for all possible permutations of atom types in your
system, that have LJ parameters. A list of combination rules can be found
`here <http://www.sklogwiki.org/SklogWiki/index.php/Combining_rules>`_.
Here's a code snippet of how to combine LJ parameters of atom types A and B
via the Lorentz-Berthelot rules::

   import itertools as it

   parameters = {'A': (epsAA, sigAA),
                 'B': (epsBB, sigBB)}

   def lorenz_berthelot(p):
       combined = {}
       for comb in it.product(p.keys(), repeat=2):
          combined[comb] = ((p[comb[0]][0] * p[comb[1]][0])**0.5,
                           (p[comb[0]][1] + p[comb[1]][1])/2)
       return combined

   combined = lorenz_berthelot(parameters)
   interaction = LJInteractions(combined)

This will (somewhat redundantly) yield::

    >>>combined
    {('A', 'A'): (epsAA, sigAA),
     ('A', 'B'): (epsAB, sigAB),
     ('B', 'A'): (epsAB, sigAB),
     ('B', 'B'): (epsBB, sigBB)}


It is also possible to run structural relaxations and molecular dynamics
using the electrostatic embedding scheme::

    from ase.constraints import FixBondLengths
    from ase.optimize import LBFGS

    mm_bonds = [(3, 4), (4, 5), (5, 3)]
    atoms.constraints = FixBondLengths(mm_bonds)
    dyn = LBFGS(atoms=atoms, trajectory='dimer.traj')
    dyn.run(fmax=0.05)

Since TIP3P is a rigid potential, we constrain all interatomic distances.
QM bond lengths can be constrained too, in the same manner.

The implementation was developed with the focus of modelling ions and complexes
in solutions, we're working on expanding its functionality to encompass
surfaces.

In broad strokes, the steps to performing QM/MM MD simulations for thermal
sampling or dynamics studies, these are the steps:

QM/MM MD General Strategy for A QM complex in an MM solvent:

1. Equillibrate an MM solvent box using one of the MM potentials built into
   ASE (see :ref:`TIPnP Water Box Equillibration` for water potentials), one
   of the compatible external MM codes, or write your own potential
   (see :ref:`Adding new calculators`)
2. Optimize the gas-phase structure of your QM complex in GPAW, analyze what
   level of accuracy you will need for your task.
3. Place the relaxed structure of the QM molecule in your MM solvent box,
   deleting overlapping MM molecules.
4. Re-equillibrate the QM/MM system.
5. Run production runs.

For these types of simulations, you'd probably want two cells: a QM (non-
periodic) and and MM cell (periodic)::

    atoms.set_pbc(True)
    # Set up calculator
    atoms.calc = EIQMMM(
        qm_idx,
        GPAW(txt='qm.out'),
        TIP3P(),
        interaction,
        embedding=embedding,
        vacuum=4.,  # Now QM cell has walls min. 4 Ã… from QM atoms
        output='qmmm.log')


This will center the QM subsystem in the MM cell.

Current limitations:

* No QM/MM border over bonds
* No QM PBCs
